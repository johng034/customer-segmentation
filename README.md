# Summary
In this project, we will work with a dataset containing data gathered from customers, such as their education level, income, purchases, number of visits to the companyâ€™s website, etc. The link to the original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).

The goal of this project is to group customers that share similar purchasing patterns to better understand each type of customer and their needs. 

This information is helpful because we could use strategies such as targeted advertising to personalize our message to each group. We could also identify certain types of customers that we may have not known about earlier. 

# Model
For this project, we used the **k-means clustering algorithm**. We decided on grouping the data into *four* clusters based on the inertia and silhouette scores for each number of clusters ranging from 2 to 12.
